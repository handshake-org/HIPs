When opening a pull request to submit a new HIP, please use the suggested template: (Link to HIP Template Github)

We may have a GitHub bot that automatically merges some PRs in the future once this process is finalized. It would merge your HIP PR immediately if certain criteria are met:

 - The PR edits only existing draft PRs.
 - The build passes.
 - Your GitHub username or email address is listed in the 'author' header of all affected PRs, inside <triangular brackets>.
 - If matching on email address, the email address is the one publicly listed on your GitHub profile.
