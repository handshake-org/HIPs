Values are encrypted using a combination of a user&amp;rsquo;s private key and other data recoverable from the blockchain.
Motivation The Handshake reference implementation (hsd) includes a wallet (hsw) that mostly conforms to BIP44. The goal of BIP44 is to allow a recovery process whereby a user could restore the complete state of their wallet using only their wallet&amp;rsquo;s master private key (usually encoded by a BIP39 seed phrase) and all the public data available on the blockchain.</description></item><item><title>Trustless Live Auctions for Handshake</title><link>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0006/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0006/</guid><description>Abstract We propose an ascending-price auction system for HNS domain names without trust or third-party custody. A name owner initiates an auction by locking their TLD with a verifiable script. Bidders place bids by partially-signing TRANSFER transactions, and the name owner eventually picks the highest bid and atomically swaps the name ownership for the payment. The protocol requires more interactivity and centralization than the current Shakedex-style HIP-0001 auction format, but with some compelling trade-offs.</description></item><item><title>Interactive Atomic Name Swaps</title><link>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0004/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0004/</guid><description>Abstract We define a protocol by which two Handshake users can agree on a price for a HNS domain name, and swap the name itself for payment in HNS using a single transaction. The buyer and seller must be able to interact before and during the protocol, and the final transaction is signed by both parties.
Motivation HNS users need a decentralized, platform-less way to sell the domain names they&amp;rsquo;ve acquired form on-chain auctions.</description></item><item><title>Name data standard for alternative namespace resolution</title><link>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0005/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0005/</guid><description>Abstract This HIP describes how to set the data for a Handshake name so that it can resolved via an external namespace or alternative consensus system. Resolution must be performed by an extension to a Handshake resolver which may not be included by default in full or light clients.
Motivation There may be various reasons to resolve a name on an alternative namespace other than a domain name or an name server hosted on an IP address.</description></item><item><title>Well Known directory for wallets address</title><link>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0002/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0002/</guid><description>Abstract This HIP describe how to publish a wallet address in a domain.
Motivation Wallet address are not human friendly. Sending an address normally involves &amp;ldquo;copy &amp;amp; paste&amp;rdquo; and is near to impossible to do via voice channels.
Since Handshake is all about owning domains, we could use them as alias to our wallet address.
Protocol The basics of this protocol consists in serving the address in an HTTPS request to the .</description></item><item><title>HIP Template</title><link>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0000/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0000/</guid><description>Abstract This is a section for an abstract.

Motivation A healthy secondary market for Handshake names will bring more activity to the Handshake economy. Without a solution for a decentralized secondary market, it is likely that most names will end up being managed on a custodial platform where there is liquidity for names.</description></item></channel></rss>
