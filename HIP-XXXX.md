## Abstract

The Handshake is the great web3.0 basic facilities, but the price of the HNS is too low to prompt the development of The Handshake. 
A important reason is that  HNS has not capture the value of renewal domain. It is necessary to charge and burn the renewal fee.

Designing a free renewal is a beautiful wish that takes HNS to heaven, but in reality, it takes HNS to the path of destruction.
Anyone with some knowledge of economics knows that treating guests for free actually requires someone to pay for it . Someone has to pay for the expensive machines and expensive electricity bills of miners who maintain the internet. The free purchase of HNS is a decrease in its market value that Miners have to pay for electricity and machinery every year, so the market value of HNS will decrease every year until it returns to zero.

## Motivation

Starting from the launch of the main network on February 17, 2020, as of November 29, 2023, for a total of 1375 days, Handshake has 12million domains and burned a total of 33million HNS. On average, it burns 24,000 HNS per day; In the past year, (33.3-29.1=4.2 million) burned an average of 11,500 HNS per day; Meanwhile, 144,000 new HNS are generated daily for miners. Therefore, the recent net inflation rate is 133,000 per day, and the current annual inflation rate is approximately 8.5%; The current total market value of Handshake is $12,362,796, and the total number of HNS is 618,139,800; The current HNS unit price is $0.02, far below the issuance price of $0.10340. 

## Body

The Handshake domain name has enormous value, but HNS performs poorly because HNS has not captured its rightful value; The average price of each Handshake domain is less than 3HNS, and at the current price of $0.06, it is still permanently valid This leads to a huge vulnerability in HNS, where HNS loses its rightful value - domain ownership value, which is the renewal fee Currently, renewal is free, which means that holding HNS domain names does not require any cost, only requiring free renewal every 2 years and paying some negligible network fees This is a huge loss for HNS, causing great harm to HNS. The harm is intuitively seen as the unit price of HNS being too low, the overall market value of Handshake being too low, even lower than many worthless air coins. This low unit price causes losses for investors and miners, leading to their gradual departure, reduced investment in mining equipment and electricity, and ultimately reduced computing power to maintain network operation, It poses a threat to the survival and development of Handshake in the future, which is not conducive to its long-term development.


In order to change the above situation, it is necessary to charge for domain name ownership at a suitable time, that is, to charge renewal fees The fee for a renewal can be between 1-10 HNS After the renewal fee is collected, it immediately burns up and injects this value into the entire Handshake network This is the simplest and most feasible way to increase HNS value capture . 

After several months of contemplation, the renewal fee adopts a fixed fee of 1HNS, which is the best mechanism.  1HNS is the simplest, most aesthetically pleasing, easiest to operate, easiest for everyone to remember, and most in line with everyone's interests.  It is the will of God.


The opposing view is that 1$HNS may be 1$, 100$, or 0.00001$, which will affect user updates. The essence of this viewpoint is causal inversion.

The price of 1$HNS is the result of market action.  Since it is the result of the market, then it is the most suitable price. This price is the result of the combined effect of renewal fee and other factors It is not necessary to associate it with the renewal fee mechanism.

For example, if I buy a 100000$ house and after 10 years, the market price of the house rises to 10million$, what should I do? Will the world collapse? I think the world won't collapse.  Don't worry at all, if it really rises to 10 million, under the influence of the real market, then let it rise to 10 million. As long as it can rise, there must be a reasonable reason and it must be the best arrangement.

If HNS reaches $100, then let it reach $100. There really came a day when it was the best arrangement in the market and the most reasonable. Handshake will not collapse for this. Didn't BTC reach $50000? Has the BTC network crashed? No, it hasn't.

The renewal cost of 1HNS will have adaptive ability . When 1HNS=100$, many low value domains will stop renewing, then the renewal fee burned will fall down, then the price will also fall down, until a new balance is reached, directly balancing the renewal fee of 1HNS with maintainable domains and the price of 1HNS;
